SERVIR’s Farm Action service was co-developed alongside several implementing partners in Bhutan to support their mission to secure adequate food for the Kingdom and save operational costs while doing it. An interactive platform for visualizing these data and exploring additional insights is available at https://crops.servirglobal.net/. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f40c3fe2-1a2e-468c-b192-501b430d4cd3)
This service provides 30-m scale cropland, rice, and maize area extent maps covering mountainous and marginal farmlands across Bhutan for all years from 2002 to 2023. The Farm Action service can also  estimate annual rice yield at district, sub-district, and field scales from 2002 to 2023, though ready-made map visualization products are currently only provided at district and sub-district levels. The robust methodological framework and semi-automated algorithms built into this service were intentionally designed  to facilitate easy adoption and sustainable operation by implementing partners. Cropland area and yield models rely primarily on Landsat sensors 5, 7, 8 and 9 surface reflectance products, showcasing how the consistent historical data record of NASA’s Landsat mission can be used to make an impact on small-holder farming livelihoods in Bhutan. This service also incorporates satellite databases on weather, biological, and topographical inputs into area and yield models. We compared several empirical modeling approaches, including simple linear discriminant models and complex machine learning methods to select optimal area and yield algorithms.

The 30-m rice area extent maps from 2002 to 2023 will help our users to understand changes in rice area and yield before and after specific events in history, such as past natural disasters, floods, wildlife intrusions, or even the COVID19 outbreak (2020). A consistent, timely, and reliable twenty year record of of 30-m cropland area can also be used to analyze the impact of policy changes on food security before and after Bhutan’s transition to a democratic constitutional monarchy in 2008. Our service aims to guide decision makers as they work to ensure the Kingdom benefits from  a sustainable, resilient, and climate-smart ecosystem into the foreseeable future.

Recently, the Kingdom of Bhutan has placed a new focus on  improving food self-sufficiency. According to national statistical reports, the country's rice area has been rapidly decreasing over the last few years. Bhutan’s National Statistical Bureau reported that although the national rice self-sufficiency was increased to ~47% in 2018, it suddenly dropped to just ~25% in 2023. So, the critical question is: which cropping systems are sustainable for the resilient livelihood and food self-sufficiency goals of Bhutan? With its effective capacity to monitor croplands, this service aims to provide information which will help find those answers..  While the currently demonstrated Farm Action service products currently describe  staple crop types (rice and maize), the algorithms can also be replicated with minor adjustments to investigate other important crop types, including economic crops. 

The primary users of this tool will be government organizations, non-government organizations,researchers, and academic institutions.
